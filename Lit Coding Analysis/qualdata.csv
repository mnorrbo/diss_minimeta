84_2,"Using Goh, Hall & Rosenthal (2016), calculated Cohen's d using adjusted means and standard deviations (controlled for IMS)","""In order to assess the robustness of the effects observed across our studies, we conducted an internal meta-analysis (Goh, Hall, &Rosenthal, 2016). Specifically, we calculated Cohen'sd for the explicit vs. implicit bias attribution effect using the means and standard deviations for each dependent variable in each study. [...] Analyses revealed a significant effect of accountability (d= 0.41,Z= 7.08,p< .001)."""
84_3,"Random effects model (REM) meta-analysis with standardized effect sizes using the metafor package (Refers to Field & Gillet, 2010: How to do a meta-analysis)","""We performed a random effects model (REM) meta-analysis for two reasons. At a theoretical level our goal was to assess the effect size of intensity differences in interethnic emotion perception for the population (Field & Gillett, 2010). At an empirical level, a REM allowed us to deal with the heterogeneity of effect sizes unlike the commonly used fixed – effect model. The results of the meta-analysis are reported as Cohen's d, followed by 95% confidence intervals. Analyses were performed using the metafor package (version 1.9–3, Viechtbauer, 2010) for R (Version 3.1.0; 2014)."""

To do so, we used Review Manager 5.3 software. Our meta-analysis revealed that being exposed to cultural disfluency had a small-to-moderate sized effect on subsequent experience of inherence, d?=?0.32 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.43, see Table 6 for details).

84_9,"Fixed effect meta-analysis (Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hedges & Vevea, 1998)","""We want to note that the three studies reported are the only three studies we have conducted. The time-orientation manipulation and creativity measures reported were also the only manipulation and measures we used. To summarize the three studies, we conducted a fixed effect meta-analysis (Hedges & Olkin, 1985; Hedges & Vevea, 1998) to estimate an overall effect of future-oriented thinking (i.e., Studies 1 & 2: future-oriented vs. present-oriented thinking; Study 3: future-orientation with high change vs. low change) on creativity."" "
84_12,"Goh, Hall & Rosenthal (2016)","Following recent advice (e.g., Cumming, 2014; Goh, Hall, & Rosenthal, 2016), we thus report an internal meta-analysis of those studies. This advice is based on the observation that measurement error, common to all psychology studies, will lead to considerable variation in effect size across studies (e.g., Stanley & Spence, 2014), and other variables—including the use of separate samples—lead to further variation (Cumming, 2014). Internal meta-analyses are based on effect sizes from multiple samples and should therefore provide more reliable information about the true effect size. This approach may be especially useful for small (but practically-meaningful) effect sizes, for which attaining sufficient a priori power requires prohibitively large sample sizes. The internal meta-analysis presented below provides an approximate effect size for how exposure to the gender-location associations influences perceivers' beliefs about women and men."
84_13,Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software (both fixed and random effects),"Another limitation is that some of our effects did not reach conventional levels of significance. To gain a better sense of the representative size of the effect in the studies where the comparison was between participants who received information regarding the current circumstances (Status-Quo Information – Provided) and those who did not (Status-Quo Information – Not Provided; i.e., Studies 3, 4A, 4B, 6, 7, and S2), we used the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software suite to conduct two internal meta-analyses. In the second meta-analysis, we excluded participants who had a repeating IP address, failed any of the attention/comprehension checks, questioned the believability of the study, indicated they had previously heard of the (fake) city in the weather studies, or indicated they had looked up information about the election in Study S2. Both the fixed-effects and random-effect models returned identical odds ratios (see Table 8; OR?=?1.63, 95% CI?=?[1.34, 1.98]; z?=?4.94; p?<?.001). "
84_20,"Rosenthal (1991), Stouffer method","""Notably, not only in Study 1, but also across the three experimental Studies 2–4, the similarity-focus evoked a stronger effect than the difference-focus. In the context of Study 2, this even results in a non-significant effect in the difference-focus condition. In light of this divergence, we further explored the robustness of the contrast effects obtained in Studies 2 through 4. To test for the overall reliability of the effect, we conducted a meta-analysis (cf. Rosenthal, 1991) across Studies 2 to 4 using the Stouffer method (weighted for dfs). The results reveal that the difference-focus provoked contrast effect seems to be reliable (z?=?2.97, p?=?.003). However, in light of the partial divergence in the results of the experimental Studies 2–4 and Study 1, it seems most prudent to conclude a difference-focus at least works against egocentric assimilation effects and might – under some conditions – result in contrast effects."""
84_25,Same analyses on pooled sample,"""Additionally, we conducted all analyses on the pooled sample of both experiments (N?=?184) in order to integrate the evidence of both experiments and to increase test power. To avoid redundancy, we report the pooled results only for Hypothesis 3 or when the results of both experiments were in conflict, because especially in these cases the increased statistical power of the pooled sample can help to disambiguate the evidence across experiments."""
84_26,"Goh, Hall & Rosenthal (2016)","""Because of this similarity in measures and methods, we present results of the individual studies in parallel followed by a mini meta-analysis across both experiments (Goh, Hall, & Rosenthal, 2016)."""
82_2,"Goh, Hall & Rosenthal (2016)","""Across the three studies, the results revealed an inconsistent association between implicit Black-poor associations and explicit policy support. To investigate the average correlation across studies, we conducted mini-meta analyses using a few different approaches (see Supplemental materials; Goh, Hall, & Rosenthal, 2016). Overall, we found a small yet significant correlation suggesting that more Black-poor implicit associations were associated with more negative attitudes toward welfare and redistribution, average r's???0.15, p's???0.05. These findings suggest that there is an overall correlation between the Black-poor association and negative attitudes toward redistribution or welfare policies."""

We meta-analyzed the effect of target political orientation on the combined outcomes of personality and moral character malleability judgments including Experiments 1, 3A-5, and a separate supplemental replication of Experiment 1 (see Footnote 7; referred to as Experiment S1 in Fig. 4) using a fixed-effects model (k?=?6).""& ""These experiments, analyzed meta-analytically, therefore provide evidence that target political orientation shapes malleability judgments.""
