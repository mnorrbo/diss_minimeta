## Navigating these files

`minimeta_simulations.Rmd` is the RMarkdown file which contains all simulations. Unless you want to spend your whole day running simulations :dizzy_face:	you can load .RData files for saved results within the script. :100:

If you are in a rush and don't want to spend time running a script, `minimeta_simulations.pdf` is a knitted pdf version of the Rmd script. :fire: For HTML fans there is also an .html document with the same contents. :zap:

`bibliography.bib` contains the references used in the script, whereas apa.csl contains the APA citation style from https://github.com/citation-style-language.
