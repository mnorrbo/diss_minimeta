## Navigating these files

`minimeta_simulations.Rmd` is the RMarkdown file which contains all simulations. Unless you want to spend your whole day running simulations :dizzy_face:	you can load .RData files for saved results within the script :100:

`minimeta_simulations.pdf` is a knitted pdf version of the Rmd script :fire: and for HTML fans there is also an .html document with the same contents :sparkles:

`bibliography.bib` contains the references used in the script, whereas `apa.csl` contains the APA citation style from https://github.com/citation-style-language.

The `figures` folder contains, you guessed it, the figures! :trophy:
